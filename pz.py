# Python library for 4tronix Picon Zero
# https://4tronix.co.uk/store/index.php?rt=product/product&product_id=552
# This code is based on the samplw code provided by 4Tronix but it has been
# built into a number of classes.

# Currently there is a base class 'Motor_Controller', this handles all the
# I2C communication

# Two other classes are 'Motor' and 'Robot', both inherrit from 'Motor_Controller'
# to control either a single motor or a pair of motors in the form of a robot

# Other functions of the board, such as inputs and outputs are still to be
# completed
